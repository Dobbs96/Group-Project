## Group Project "The Best of Me"

# Description

Here in America, there is a lot of focus on working, building a family, doing action items and what is ignored is our mental health. "The Best of Me" our web application is there to increase your life satisfaction and keep your hopes high. As such, we have created a safe app for people to incorporate into their daily schedule. Users between the ages of 13-100 can come to our page, receive motivational quotes, and feel inspired to add 1-2 new activities to their life for that day that will wrap them in self love. 
The app feeds the user with inspirational quotes and affirmations to remind them to see the best in themselves, their potential, and tangible goal for contentment with themselves. 
We have a team of developers who are bringing together their unique strengths to making this app a success. We agree that our users can benefit from taking actionable steps that expand their limitations.
